# Database Setup for Shopping Kart

## MongoDB Setup

The Shopping Kart application uses MongoDB as its database. Follow these steps to set up and use the database:

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed on your system
   - You can verify this by running `mongod --version` in your terminal
   - If not installed, download and install from [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Starting MongoDB

1. Start the MongoDB server:
   ```
   mongod
   ```
   - You may need to run this in a separate terminal window and keep it running

2. The application is configured to connect to MongoDB at `mongodb://localhost:27017` with database name `Shopping`

### Seeding the Database

A seed script has been provided to populate the database with initial product data:

1. Run the seed script:
   ```
   node seed-products.js
   ```

2. This will add sample products to your database for testing

## Database Structure

### Products Collection

The main collection used in the application is `products` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,          // Automatically generated by MongoDB
  name: String,           // Product name
  category: String,       // Product category (e.g., 'Electronics')
  price: Number,          // Product price
  description: String,    // Product description
  image: String,          // URL or path to product image
  badge: String           // Optional badge (e.g., 'new', 'sale')
}
```

## Database Operations

The application implements the following database operations:

1. **Create**: Add new products through the admin interface at `/admin/products/new`
2. **Read**: View products on the homepage and admin products page
3. **Update**: Edit existing products through `/admin/products/:id/edit`
4. **Delete**: Remove products using the delete button on the edit page

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. Ensure MongoDB server is running
2. Check that the connection URL in `config/connection.js` matches your MongoDB setup
3. Verify that the database name is correct
4. Check console logs for specific error messages

## Next Steps

Future database enhancements could include:

1. User authentication and accounts
2. Order processing and history
3. Shopping cart persistence
4. Product reviews and ratings
